## Merging Guidelines
- Create new branch with your edit and make a pull request

## Code Style Guidelines
- Include order
  1. C/C++ Libraries
  2. Third-party libraries (SFML)
  3. Local files
- Naming
  - Functions and variables would be like_this (all lowercase with underscores)
  - Class names should be LikeThis (no underscores)
- Header files should be .hpp (not .h)
- Put  `#pragma once` at the beginning of header files
- If unsure about something, look at similar examples in already existing code
